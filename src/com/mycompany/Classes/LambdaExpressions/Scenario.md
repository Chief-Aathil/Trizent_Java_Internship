Read [this][1] for context  
Summary:
You have an application where user data is stored as `Person` class objects.

You need to iterate through a `List<Person>` to search for a given criteria and perform some action when the criteria is
matched.

In this example, as the action to be performed, we are printing the matched `Person` objects for simplicity.
